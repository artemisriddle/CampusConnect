# CampusConnect

Capstone project created by myself (jesllagr@ut.utm.edu) and David Hudson (davkhuds@ut.utm.edu)

This is a prototype for a mobile class registration system for Android devices modeled after Banner.
This application is meant to run on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or better as a test of Google Material Design principles.

All student data is fabricated, and the database is of our own creation and structure.

Non-coded assests including a paper describing the project and the presentation given at ACM Mid-Southeast conference in Fall 2015 can be found at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4pPn4ZYjdCiaVh2YW5UWWlIRFk&usp=sharing

This application and presentation does not represent the view or goals of the UT Martin administration or Computer Science department, it is meant simply as a conversation starter for those of us who would like a better course registration system.
